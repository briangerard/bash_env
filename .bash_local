# $HOME_HOST is used to indicate the desktop, laptop, or other physical
# host where I actually login and from which I log in to other hosts in
# a network.  Kind of the "master" host, in other words.  Also, the only
# place I might need mail, browser, or X-windows settings, for example.
# No default.
